#Druidic		TYPE:Spoken.Written.Read.Druid.Secret		"PREVARGTEQ:DruidicLanguage,1"
#
#####
#Druidic and Halfling are language names. The name must be the first field on each line. Other LST files will reference a
#language by the name. Every language needs a name.
#
#The TYPE tag is used to set the type/group of the language. It may take multiple types delimited by periods. The types used
#are usually Spoken, Read, and Written. Every language should have at least one type."
#In the second Example the PREVARGTEQ tag is used to allow selection of the language only, if the character has the"
#DruidicLanguage variable at a value of 1 or higher. The DruidicLanguage will only be set elsewhere, when a character becomes"
#eligible to learn the language, for instance by acquiring the Druid class. There is a multitude of existing prerequiste tags"
#in PCGen. If you are looking into the documentation under List File Tag Index, you can find them listed under the topic"
#""PRExxx tags""."
