#	Skill Focus		CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:General.SkillFocus	DESC:You are particularly adept at your chosen skill.	STACK:NO	MULT:YES	CHOOSE:SKILL|TYPE=Charisma|TYPE=Dexterity|TYPE=Intelligence|TYPE=Strength|TYPE=Wisdom	SOURCEPAGE:p.134	BENEFIT:You get a +3 bonus on all checks involving the chosen skill. If you have 10 or more ranks in that skill, this bonus increases to +6.
# The bonus to the skill is in the Skill File, however, you can bonus the skill directly by adding the following:
#	BONUS:SKILL|%LIST|3
# %LIST is a substitution, and then the number is applied to the chosen skill(s).

#####
#Each feat takes one line and the first field must be the feat's name. In the Example the name of the feat is Skill Focus.
#When naming feats you should only use parentheses at the end of the name if the name is not duplicated elsewhere. This is
#because of how PCGen names feats which can be taken multiple times. For example, the Feat Weapon Focus when taken will display
#as Weapon Focus(Dagger). Another example is Armor Proficiency (Light), there is no feat named Armor Proficiency so this name
#is fine. What is happening is when PCGen finds a feat with parentheses that duplicates the name of another feat it assumes
#that feat is an instance of the one without parentheses and does not display the one with parentheses.
#
#The TYPE tag is holding a . (period) delimited list of the types the feat is.
#
#The DESC tag is used to hold the description of the Feat. In our files we usually keep the description brief, so the user
#still need to own the book to make use of of the data, but for your personal files can get as elaborate as you want there.
#
#The MULT tag determines if a feat can be taken multiple times. If the value is set to YES, then you MUST also use a CHOOSE
#tag.
#
#The CHOOSE tag must be paired with a MULT:YES tag in feats for it to work properly. It will display a popup window that asks
#for a selection according to what is being called for. There is a multitude of existing CHOOSE tags in PCGen. If you are
#looking into the documentation under List File Tag Index, you can find them listed under the topic "CHOOSE tags".
#
#The BONUS tags are a group of similar tags, that grant some form of Bonus to another already existing tag. To read a description
#of them, look in the List File Tag Index under the topic "Bonus tags".
#
#The SOURCEPAGE tag can be used to hold a reference to where you can find the feat. This will be displayed in PCGen.
