Asmodeus's Obedience		NAMEISPI:Yes	KEY:Deific Obedience ~ Asmodeus					CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Faith Based Obedience.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.20		DESC:Using a ruby-bladed knife, inscribe symmetrical cuts into the flesh of another creature-preferably an unwilling sentient being you own or hold dominion over. Drain the victim's blood into a bowl of bone made from the skull of a sentient humanoid. The amount of blood drained is up to you; you don't have to drain so much that you make the creature weak or too useless to serve you. Use the bowl of blood to draw a large pentagram on the ground. Kneel within the pentagram and concentrate on the glory you will bring to the Prince of Darkness's name. Gain a +4 profane bonus on saving throws against fire effects.

Pitiless Judgment			KEY:Evangelist Boon ~ Asmodeus ~ Pitiless Judgment			CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:Faith Based Boon.SpecialQuality.SpellLike			DESC:Each day, upon performing your obedience, choose one of the following spell-like abilities: Wrath 3/day, Flames of the Faithful 2/day, or Bestow Curse 1/day		ABILITY:Internal|AUTOMATIC|Temp Bonus ~ Evangelist of Asmodeus|PREMULT:2,[PREVARGTEQ:DeificObedienceActive,1],[PRECLASS:1,Evangelist=1]
Tireless Judgment			KEY:Evangelist Boon ~ Asmodeus ~ Tireless Judgment			CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:Faith Based Boon.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESC:If you have performed your daily obedience, you gain Favored Judgment as a bonus feat, choosing chaotic outsider, good outsider, or a subtype of humanoid. If you don't have the judgment class feature, you instead gain a +4 profane bonus on Survival checks made to track a creature or individual. This boon doesn't grant you any ranks in the Survival skill; therefore, if you have no ranks, you still can follow tracks only if the DC of the task is 10 or lower.
Resounding Judgment			KEY:Evangelist Boon ~ Asmodeus ~ Resounding Judgment		CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:Faith Based Boon.SpecialQuality.SpellLike			DESC:If you have performed your daily obedience, once per day, you can channel the effects of resounding blow through your weapon, though you don't need to cast (or even know) the spell. You must declare your use of this ability before you make the attack roll. On a hit, the target is affected as if you had cast resounding blow before your attack, and the surrounding area rings with the sound of vicious, booming laughter. You don't gain the stunning effect of the spell unless you have access to the judgment or smite ability. If your attack misses, the resounding blow effect is wasted.

Embersight					KEY:Exalted Boon ~ Asmodeus ~ Embersight					CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:Faith Based Boon.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:If you have performed your daily obedience, your eyes take on the appearance of red-hot, glowing embers, granting you the ability to see in darkness much like devils. You gain darkvision to a range of 60 feet. If you chose either darkness or deeper darkness as the spell-like ability granted by your first boon, you can also see perfectly through both darkness and deeper darkness. If you already have darkvision to a range of 60 feet or more, instead increase the range of your darkvision by 10 feet. Your eyes make you extremely distinctive, causing you to take a -4 penalty on Disguise checks.
Hellfire Blast				KEY:Exalted Boon ~ Asmodeus ~ Hellfire Blast				CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:Faith Based Boon.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary		DESC:If you have performed your daily obedience, you can use delayed blast fireball once per day as a spell-like ability to throw a sphere of soulÂ­scouring hellfire. The hellfire is a distinctive mixture of black and crimson flames in which screaming devilish faces can be seen twisting and writhing. Half the damage from this spell is fire, while the other half is unholy.

Three times per day, you can attempt a feint as a swift action. You gain a +4 profane bonus on your Bluff check when attempting to feint using this ability. If you successfully attack a creature that has lost its Dexterity bonus to AC as a result of your feint, you deal an additional 1d6 points of damage. This is in addition to any other precision-based damage you deal-such as from a sneak attack-and isn't multiplied on a critical hit.	DESCISPI:YES
Diabolical Resistances		KEY:Sentinel Boon ~ Asmodeus ~ Diabolical Resistances		CATEGORY:Special Ability		TYPE:Faith Based Boon.SpecialQuality.Supernatural		DESC:If you have performed your daily obedience, your dark patron rewards your faith with a few drops of devilish blood in your veins, granting you a measure of the resilience enjoyed by devilkind. Your skin takes on a ruddy cast, and your teeth grow slightly sharper. To a casual observer you may look no different, but anyone who studies you closely notices these traits.
